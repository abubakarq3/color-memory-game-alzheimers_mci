# Enhancing Cognitive Abilities in Individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease and MCI using Color Memory Game

## Introduction

The **Color Memory Game** is an interactive tool designed to support **cognitive stimulation** in individuals with **Alzheimer’s disease** and **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)**.

By combining **memory-based challenges** with **Leap Motion technology**, this game aims to provide a fun, engaging, and therapeutic experience that promotes:

- Improved **memory recall**
- Increased **focus and attention**
- Ongoing **cognitive engagement**

  

##  Purpose

Games designed to challenge **memory**, **problem-solving**, and **attention** have been shown to help **delay cognitive decline** by keeping the brain actively engaged. This project serves as an innovative approach to delivering such stimulation through immersive gameplay.

##  Key Features of XR Interaction Modalities

-  **Leap Motion Control**: Players use their hands to interact with the game in an intuitive and natural way.
-  **Virtual Painting Mechanic**: Using Leap Motion, players grab a virtual brush to select colors from a palette and “paint” the objects to match their original colors.
-  **Tactile and Engaging Gameplay**: The physicality of painting and color selection boosts sensory engagement and immersion.

##  Game Levels and Progression

The game is structured into **five progressively challenging levels**, each designed to test and improve memory and cognitive skills:

- **Level 1**: Introduces a single cube with a small set of colors — a gentle start to learn the mechanics.
- **Subsequent Levels**: Add more complexity by introducing **additional shapes** (spheres, cylinders) and **more colors** to memorize.
- **Challenge Mechanic**: To progress, the player must correctly complete **three rounds per level**. Failing to do so restarts the level, encouraging focus, perseverance, and learning through repetition.

This progression encourages both **short-term memory use** and **attention span extension** in a fun, gamified way.
